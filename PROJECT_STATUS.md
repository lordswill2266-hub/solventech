## 📊 Current Status

### Backend
- ✅ All modules implemented
- ✅ Database connected (Neon PostgreSQL)
- ✅ Server running successfully
- ✅ Swagger documentation live
- ✅ 0 compilation errors

### Mobile App
- ⏳ Flutter SDK downloading/extracting
- 📋 Architecture planned (BLoC pattern)
- 📋 Ready to build once Flutter is set up

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option A: Complete Flutter Setup (Recommended)
1. Wait for Flutter extraction to finish
2. Create Flutter project
3. Build authentication screens
4. Connect to backend API

**OR manually extract** the zip file to `C:\src\flutter` using Windows Explorer (faster!)

### Option B: Continue Backend Development
While Flutter installs, add:
- File upload for images
- Push notifications
- Admin dashboard
- Analytics

### Option C: Test & Deploy Backend
- Test all endpoints thoroughly
- Deploy to production (Railway/Render)
- Set up CI/CD

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Best approach:** Manually extract Flutter zip using Windows Explorer to `C:\src\flutter` - it's much faster than PowerShell extraction!

Then I can immediately create the mobile app.
